# Learning Python

This project shows my progress with python

## Getting Started

**Basic Projects** - This were my first python projects, cli scripts that calculate pi with n number of decimals, and fibonacci n number of times

**Basic OOP** - Very basic object-oriented project with the intent to register a movie and then request and return  it

**Basic OOP v2** - Same project as before but now the movies are a list of the top 100 movies of imdb, which i scrape, and now also stores the movies and requests in files.

**Machine Learning(ML)** -

1. Basic ML Script using the [iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) , to calculate the iris species using the sepal length and width, as well as petal length and width.

2. My Second ML project with the goal to predict the object [airplane,automobile,bird,cat,deer,dog,frog,horse,ship,truck] using the [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.
